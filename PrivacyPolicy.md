##ARventure: Privacy Policy
Welcome to the ARventure Privacy Policy.

This is an open source Android app developed by Nurul Farizah Ridzuan.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

###Data collected
I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences such as audio settings created by the you (the user) is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply be erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.

###App permissions
The main feature of this app involves the use of the device's camera, thus, the app may require you to allow the camera usage permission before using the app. This permission does not involve the collection of any sensitive data from the user.

###Target audience
This app is mainly targeted for users of age 13 - 15 due to the origins of the learning material (Chapter 10 â€“ Space Exploration from the Kurikulum Standard Sekolah Menengah (KSSM) Science Form 3 syllabus). However, the content of the app is suitable for all ages.

The contents of the app (such as 3D models, videos, scrapbook, flashcards, links, etc) are assured to be suitable for all ages and does not present anything other than what was intended.
